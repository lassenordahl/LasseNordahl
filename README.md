## Howdy 👋

I'm Lasse, a senior at UC Irvine majoring in Computer Science!

Currently I'm working @ The New York Times on the R&D Team. Here I'm playing around with OCR and NLP for information extraction.

Feel free to explore my github, or even better check out my website [lassenordahl.com](http://www.lassenordahl.com) :)
